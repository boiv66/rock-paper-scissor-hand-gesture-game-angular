- Design for those who want to experience extraordinary interaction and playing game in special way by illustrating hand gesture. 

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
- Swipe left: when user open hand, and move their hand from right to left. 
- Swipie right: similar to swipe left gesture but in opposite direction, from left to right.  


8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
- Make a consistent interface with same theme and standard 
- Recognition rather than recall, having instruction rule so that users don't have to remember how to interact with software 
- Minimalist design: not too much feature and everything is vividly display. Not confusing user. 
- Visibility process: know when they are supposed to do hand gesture for new input, and illustrate if 
the gesture game choice has successfully recored.
